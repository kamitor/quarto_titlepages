# Resilience Report Generator

## üåü Overview

The **Resilience Report Generator** is a powerful system designed to automate the creation and dissemination of customized Strategic Resilience and Financial Performance Profiles. Developed as part of the **ResilienceScan initiative at Hogeschool Windesheim** by Ronald de Boer and collaborators, this tool empowers users to generate insightful, data-driven PDF reports for individual entities based on a master dataset.

This project leverages a combination of **Python** for orchestration, **Quarto** for dynamic document generation, **R** for data analysis and visualization within reports, and **LaTeX** for high-quality PDF typography and layout. For Windows users, it also includes functionality to automate emailing reports via Microsoft Outlook.

This README provides guidance on setting up the environment, using the generator, understanding its architecture, and contributing to its future development.

*   **Python** (version 3.8 or newer)
*   **R** (version 4.0 or newer)
*   **Quarto CLI** (version 1.3 or newer)
*   A **LaTeX distribution** (TinyTeX is recommended and can be installed via Quarto)
*   The custom font **`QTDublinIrish.otf`** (included in this repository)

### Automated Installer (Windows)

For Windows users, an automated installer script is provided to simplify the setup process.

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**
    *   **Using Git (Recommended):**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
        cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
        ```
        *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with the actual GitHub path)*
    *   **Manual Download:** Download the project as a ZIP file from GitHub, then extract its **entire contents** to a folder (e.g., `C:\ResilienceProject`).

2.  **Run the Installer:**
    *   Navigate into the project folder.
    *   Double-click the `run_installer.bat` file.
    *   A PowerShell window will open. Follow the on-screen prompts. The script will check for necessary software and guide you through any missing installations. This may take several minutes, especially for LaTeX.

3.  **Post-Installation:**
    *   A system restart or logging out/in might be needed for the custom font (`QTDublinIrish.otf`) to be fully recognized.

### Manual Installation (All Platforms)

Advanced users or those on macOS/Linux can install components manually.

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository** (as described above).

2.  **Python (3.8+):**
    *   Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure it's added to your system PATH.
    *   Install required Python packages:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas pywin32
        ```
        *(Note: `pywin32` is for the Windows Outlook emailing feature and can be skipped on other OS if not using that feature).*

3.  **R (4.0+):**
    *   Install from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/). Ensure it's added to your system PATH.
    *   Install required R packages (from an R console):
        ```R
        install.packages(c("readr", "dplyr", "stringr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "fmsb", "scales"))
        ```

4.  **Quarto CLI (1.3+):**
    *   Install from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). Ensure it's added to your system PATH.

5.  **LaTeX Distribution:**
    *   **Recommended for Quarto:** Install TinyTeX by running `quarto install tinytex` in your terminal. This might require administrator/sudo privileges.
    *   **Alternatively:** Install a full LaTeX distribution: TeX Live (all platforms), MiKTeX (Windows), or MacTeX (macOS).

6.  **Custom Font (`QTDublinIrish.otf`):**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow & Usage

Execute these commands from your terminal, ensuring you are in the project's root directory.

### 1. Prepare Data

The system relies on a `cleaned_master.csv` file located in the `data/` directory.

*   **Source Data:** Your primary data source is expected to be a CSV file named `Resilience - MasterDatabase(MasterData).csv` (or similar) placed in the `data/` directory.
*   **Data Cleaning:** A Python script, `clean_data.py`, is provided to process this source file into the required `cleaned_master.csv` format.
    ```bash
    python clean_data.py
    ```
    Review `clean_data.py` if your source file name or initial structure differs.

### 2. Generate Reports

This script reads `data/cleaned_master.csv` and generates a PDF report for each unique company listed.
```bash
python generate_reports.py
```

Generated PDFs will be saved in the reports/ subfolder, named after the company.

3. Send Emails (Optional, Windows/Outlook)

This feature is for Windows users with Microsoft Outlook installed and configured.

Configuration: Before the first run, open send_emails.py in a text editor:

Set TEST_MODE = False to send emails to the actual recipient addresses from cleaned_master.csv.

When TEST_MODE = True (default), emails are sent to the TEST_EMAIL address defined in the script. Update this for your testing purposes.

Execution:

python send_emails.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Ensure reports have been generated first. Outlook may prompt for permission to allow programmatic access.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Architecture

The generator is composed of several key scripts and resources:

Setup & Installation:

run_installer.bat (Windows): User-friendly launcher for the PowerShell installer.

install_environment.ps1 (Windows): PowerShell script to check and install dependencies.

Core Python Scripts:

clean_data.py: Pre-processes the raw master data CSV into a cleaned format (cleaned_master.csv) suitable for report generation.

generate_reports.py: Orchestrates the report generation. It reads cleaned_master.csv, iterates through companies, and invokes Quarto to render the template for each.

send_emails.py: (Windows-specific) Automates sending the generated PDF reports using Microsoft Outlook.

Quarto Template:

example_3.qmd: The master Quarto document that serves as the template for individual reports. It includes:

YAML Frontmatter: Defines document properties, LaTeX class options, custom PDF styling elements (like title pages, logos, background images), bibliography, and parameterization (params$company).

R Code Chunks ({r}): Embedded R code to:

Load and filter data from cleaned_master.csv for the specific params$company.

Perform calculations (e.g., pillar scores, averages).

Generate dynamic visualizations (radar charts, bar plots) using ggplot2 and fmsb.

Markdown Content: Narrative text interspersed with inline R code (r ...) to display dynamic values.

LaTeX Customizations: Direct LaTeX commands for fine-grained control over PDF structure and appearance.

Data & Resources:

data/:

Resilience - MasterDatabase(MasterData).csv (Example name for your raw input data).

cleaned_master.csv: The processed data used by the report generator.

reports/: Output directory where generated PDF reports are saved.

img/: Contains images used in the Quarto template (logos, background images).

tex/: Holds supplementary LaTeX files (e.g., copyright.tex, dedication.tex) included in the PDF.

fonts/: Includes the custom font QTDublinIrish.otf.

references.bib: Bibliography file for citations within the report.

Workflow Summary:

Raw Data (.csv) -> clean_data.py

cleaned_master.csv + example_3.qmd (with R & LaTeX) -> generate_reports.py (calls quarto render)

Individual PDF Reports (reports/*.pdf) -> send_emails.py (optional)

üí° Future Development & Contributions

This project serves as a robust foundation for generating resilience profiles. We envision several potential enhancements and welcome contributions:

Enhanced Configuration:

External configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) for paths, email settings, report parameters, rather than hardcoding in scripts.

More flexible data source specification.

Cross-Platform Emailing: Implement a cross-platform email solution (e.g., using SMTP libraries) as an alternative to the Windows-specific Outlook automation.

Expanded Output Formats: Add support for HTML or other report formats via Quarto.

Improved Error Handling & Logging: Implement more comprehensive error catching and logging throughout the scripts for easier debugging.

User Interface: Develop a simple GUI (e.g., using Tkinter, PyQt, or a web framework like Flask/Django) for easier non-technical user interaction.

Report Customization Interface: Allow users to select report sections or customize parameters through an interface.

Batch Processing Controls: More sophisticated controls for selecting which companies to process.

Internationalization (i18n): Support for multiple languages in report templates and UI.

Testing Suite: Develop unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.

Documentation: Expand on data requirements, template customization, and advanced usage scenarios.

‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Font Not Displaying: Ensure QTDublinIrish.otf is installed system-wide and try restarting/logging out.

LaTeX/PDF Errors:

Verify TinyTeX (or your LaTeX distribution) is correctly installed and accessible to Quarto (quarto check pdf). Re-run quarto install tinytex if needed (possibly with admin rights).

Examine the .tex file (if keep-tex: true is set in example_3.qmd) for specific LaTeX errors.

Package Not Found (Python/R): Use the installer or manual package installation steps. Check internet/firewall if downloads fail.

Email Script Fails (Outlook): Confirm Outlook is installed, configured, and running. Ensure pywin32 is installed.

PowerShell Execution Policy (Windows Installer): The .bat file attempts to bypass this. If issues persist, you might need to temporarily adjust the policy (see installer script comments or online guides for Set-ExecutionPolicy).
